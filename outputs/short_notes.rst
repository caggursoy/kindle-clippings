My childhood curiosity has never evaporated. I became a scientist as a consequence of striving to understand the true meaning behind explanations. Too ofen, what my peers understood to be a logical and straightforward answer remained a mystery to me. I had difculty comprehending gravity in high school.OK, it is an “action at a distance” or a force that attracts a body having mass toward another physical body. But are these statements not just another way of saying the same thing? My physics teacher’s answer about gravity reminded me the explanation of Rüszü’s abilities given by “my” scientist. My troubles with explanatory terms only deepened during my medical student and postdoctoral years afer I realized that my dear mentor, Endre Grastyán, and my postdoctoral advisor, Cornelius (Case) Vanderwolf, shared my frustration. Too ofen, when we do not understand something, we make up a word or two and pretend that those words solve the mystery.
